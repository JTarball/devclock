This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

This project is set up to deploy as a static site to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using the [official Next.js GitHub Pages flow](https://github.com/nextjs/deploy-github-pages):

1. Push code to the `main` branch.
2. In the repo go to **Settings → Pages → Source** and choose **GitHub Actions**.
3. The workflow runs on every push to `main` and deploys the contents of `out` to GitHub Pages.

Your site will be available at `https://<username>.github.io/devclock/`.

To build locally with the same base path as production:

```bash
PAGES_BASE_PATH=/devclock npm run build
```

### Ticket stats (closed issues)

The page shows closed issue counts for **jtarball** and **nbettencourt** (by author, closed on or after 4 Feb 2026). Stats are read from **ticket-stats.json** at build time; that file is generated by a script so the Next.js build never calls the GitHub API.

- **In CI**: The deploy workflow runs `node scripts/fetch-ticket-stats.js` before `npm run build`, with `GITHUB_REPO` and `GITHUB_TOKEN` (e.g. `GH_PAGES_STATS_TOKEN`) set. The script writes `ticket-stats.json`; the build then uses it.
- **Locally**: Run `npm run fetch-stats` (with `GITHUB_REPO` and optionally `GITHUB_TOKEN` in the environment), then `npm run build`. The build will use the generated `ticket-stats.json`. Without that file, the build falls back to fetching from the API (which often gives 0 if the repo is private or token is missing).

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
